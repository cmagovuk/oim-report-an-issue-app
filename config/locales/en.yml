# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at https://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

        <p class="govuk-body">
          Thank you for completing this online form. Your submission has been successfully received by the Office for the Internal Market (OIM).
        </p>
        <!-- <p class="govuk-body">If you have provided an email address, you will receive automated confirmation of your submission.</p> -->
        <p class="govuk-body">We will respond in the next 5 working days.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">Although we can bring issues to the attention of the UK government and devolved administrations through our reporting, the OIM cannot resolve issues directly, enforce the requirements set out in the UK Internal Market Act, or provide advice and support to individuals or businesses. However, we will respond to your submission individually, sharing relevant guidance and potential sources of assistance where possible.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          The information you share with us about issues in the UK internal market is invaluable in enabling us to monitor how trade within the UK is functioning and to identify emerging issues. It informs our reporting to governments, helping them to understand the impact of laws on businesses and consumers around the UK.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          For a reminder of how the OIM will use the information that you submit, you can view the CMAâ€™s <a href="%{link_info_charter}" class="govuk-link" target="_blank">personal information charter</a> and <a href="%{link_statement}" class="govuk-link" target="_blank">statement on transparency and disclosure</a>.
